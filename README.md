# CupcakeBot
A Discord bot for my personal use.

Updated mostly for Discord.py 2.0

# To-Do
* >[] Migrate fully to hybrid commands
* >[X] Add more commands
* >[X] Find a better MAL API
* >[X] Switched to 'aiohttp' from 'requests'
* >[] Add a better syncing command
* >[] Fix README

# User Commands
* >say <What you want to say> - Makes the bot say something
* >anime <title> - Searches MAL for anime
* >waifu <sfw/nsfw> - Posts a random waifu picture based on your preference
* >facts - Sends a random fun fact
* >aniquote <name of character> - Posts a random quote of a specified character. If no characters are specified, it randomly grabs a quote.


# Moderator Commands
* I will be updating the commands here because most of them, discord does better.

# Admin Commands
* >getchaninfo - Gets the channel ID
* >purge <amount> - Purges the messages in a channel with the specified amount
* >syncnow - Syncs commands
* >load <extension_name> - Loads specific cogs (ex: ?load cogs.anime | ?load helpers.listener)
* >unload <extension_name> - Unloads specific cogs (ex: ?unload cogs.anime | ?unload helpers.listener)
* >reload <extension_name> - Reloads specific cogs (ex: ?reload cogs.anime | ?reload helpers.listener)

# Notes
* >CupcakeBot relies heavily on 'dotenv' and 'aiohttp'. You can set various variables in the '.env.example' file and change it to your liking - just make sure you rename it to '.env'.
* >Some commands are still a work in progress since this bot is supposedly just for my personal use.
